Copy the Player & Camera object instances from the @ Templates layout to your templates / repo layout\n3. Make sure you have the Gamepad, Keyboard, Mouse and Touch \"object types\" (plugins) in your project (you can copy or create them). \"Use mouse input\" on Touch should be disabled.\n4. Copy sheets or their contents from this project to yours. If you're using my blank template, you don't need to copy the vNames and vPrimitives sheets.\n5. Make sure you have a layer named \"Main\", or change the layer name in the \"spawn\" custom action."
