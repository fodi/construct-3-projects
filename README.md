# Fodi's Construct 3 templates / example projects
This monorepo contains a bunch of Construct 3 projects I'd like to share with the community. Most of them are examples, some provide integrations with 3rd party libraries or services.

## Usage
Clone the repo or [download the ZIP archive](https://github.com/fodi/construct-3-projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), then find the project you're looking for in the `projectfolders` folder & open it as a project folder in Construct 3.

If you prefer `.c3p` project files, you can find them in the `projectfiles` folder.

Note: the confusingly named `docs` folder actually contains the HTML5 exported versions of most projects, this is the root folder for the GitHub pages.

You can visit this URL to browse and run the exported projects in your browser (Chromium derivatives are recommended, but hopefully Firefox should work fine too):
